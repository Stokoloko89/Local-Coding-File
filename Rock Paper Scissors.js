/* Your game is going to play against the computer, 
so begin with a function called computerPlay 
that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. 
We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play. 
Tip: use the console to make sure this is 
returning the expected output before moving to the next step! */
